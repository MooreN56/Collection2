In Lab 4 I had a button change colors when it was clicked and a different color when a key was pressed.
In Lab 5 I had a similar button, but there were two and they were different colors. Text was overlayed over the buttons and some disappeared when the button was pressed.
Lab 7 I had different shapes translated and rotated
In Lab 8 I added text to a motivational poster
In Lab 9 I created a grey pixelated image.
